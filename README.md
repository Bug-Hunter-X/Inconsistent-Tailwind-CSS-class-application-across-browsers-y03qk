# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied consistently across different browsers or devices.  The issue is likely related to CSS specificity, conflicting stylesheets, or incorrect configuration.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` uses standard Tailwind CSS classes for styling. However, in certain browsers or under specific conditions, some or all of the styles may not be applied as expected.  This inconsistency can lead to a broken user experience.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a build command (e.g., `npm run build` if using a bundler).
3. Test the resulting component in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Note any discrepancies in styling.
4. Test on different devices, including mobile devices.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing the CSS specificity, ensuring that Tailwind's styles are correctly overriding any conflicting styles. This may involve using more specific selectors or adjusting the order of stylesheets.
